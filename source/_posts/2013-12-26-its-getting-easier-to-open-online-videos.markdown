In previous versions, MPlayerX could play the videos in [Youtube.com](http://www.youtube.com) directly.

However, you have to copy the URL → open MPlayerX → open URL panel → paste the URL, kind of annoying and even stop myself using this feature.

From 1.0.21, MPlayerX simplifies the usage much more, furthermore, [vimeo](http://vimeo.com), [youku](http://youku.com), [Instagram](http://instagram.com) are getting supported.

Here is how to:
<!-- more -->

### 1. Drag the link directly

{% img /images/MPlayerX-Open-URL/001.jpg 800 500 1 %}

{% img /images/MPlayerX-Open-URL/002.jpg 800 500 1 %}

{% img /images/MPlayerX-Open-URL/003.jpg 800 500 1 %}

### 2. Open the URL in Services menu

### In case you don't see "MPlayerX: Open URL" in the contextual menu, please go to System Preference to enable it.

Note: if there is no entry in System Preference, you could log off and on once. Sometimes OS needs to re-login to find the necessary info from application's package.
