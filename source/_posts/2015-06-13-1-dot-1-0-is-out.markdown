Finally I managed to make some time to work this out.

Except the change on the look, I'd like to introduce some interesting changes internally.

### 1. Partial update.

By far, The most issues I have received is that ___MPlayerX was unable to play some file.___ Most of the time, such issue is not related with MPlayerX itself, but ffmpeg or mplayer which works as the player core inside of MPlayerX.

So I introduced this so called ___Partial Update___ into 1.1.0, which enable me to update the ffmpeg/mplayer part without updatig the whole app. Hopfully It could help me to update the player core to resolve your playback issues more quickly.

<!-- more -->

It is still a hidden settings, for the one who only wants to know how to enable it, here you go

        cd ~/Library/Preferences
        defaults write org.niltsh.MPlayerX CorePartialUpdate 1

For the one who wants to know how it works, please give me 5 minutes to explain the mechanism.

MPlayerX now wraps the core part as a bundle. Each time it starts, it will check ~/Library/Application Support/MPlayerX/bundles, if there has the latest bundle, MPlayerX will just use it, Otherwize, MPlayerX will overwirte with the default bundle inside of the App first.

Afer that, MPlayerX will check a separate channel if there is any update for these bundles, if there is a match, it will download and replace the bundles at next start-up.

And you will receive a notification as below,

### 2. HTTPS support

About a yeaer ago, Youtube started to transfer all their video links into https, which broke MPlayerX's online playback totally. Now MPlayerX add the support for https, and please enjoy the non-ads video again.

There are still other trivial optimizations to find out, please enjoy the new version of MPlayerX.

Thank you.
