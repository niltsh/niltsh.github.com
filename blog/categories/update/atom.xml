    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Finally I managed to make some time to work this out.</p>

<p>Except the change on the look, I'd like to introduce some interesting changes internally.</p>

<h3>1. Partial update.</h3>

<p>By far, The most issues I have received is that <strong><em>MPlayerX was unable to play some file.</em></strong> Most of the time, such issue is not related with MPlayerX itself, but ffmpeg or mplayer which works as the player core inside of MPlayerX.</p>

<p>So I introduced this so called <strong><em>Partial Update</em></strong> into 1.1.0, which enable me to update the ffmpeg/mplayer part without updatig the whole app. Hopfully It could help me to update the player core to resolve your playback issues more quickly.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>It is still a hidden settings, for the one who only wants to know how to enable it, here you go</p>

<pre><code>    cd ~/Library/Preferences
    defaults write org.niltsh.MPlayerX CorePartialUpdate 1
</code></pre>

<p>For the one who wants to know how it works, please give me 5 minutes to explain the mechanism.</p>

<p>MPlayerX now wraps the core part as a bundle. Each time it starts, it will check ~/Library/Application Support/MPlayerX/bundles, if there has the latest bundle, MPlayerX will just use it, Otherwize, MPlayerX will overwirte with the default bundle inside of the App first.</p>

<p><img src="/images/partial-update/partialupdate-bundles.png" alt="bundles" /></p>

<p>Afer that, MPlayerX will check a separate channel if there is any update for these bundles, if there is a match, it will download and replace the bundles at next start-up.</p>

<p>And you will receive a notification as below,</p>

<p><img src="/images/partial-update/partialupdate-notif.png" alt="notification" /></p>

<h3>2. HTTPS support</h3>

<p>About a yeaer ago, Youtube started to transfer all their video links into https, which broke MPlayerX's online playback totally. Now MPlayerX add the support for https, and please enjoy the non-ads video again.</p>

<p>There are still other trivial optimizations to find out, please enjoy the new version of MPlayerX.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
